# Software Testing

Software testing refers to a series of activities that are performed to evaluate the quality and reliability of software, and to detect and fix defects and issues. Software testing is generally divided into two types: manual testing and automated testing.

## Manual Testing

Manual testing is the process of testing software manually by following a predetermined test plan and test cases. It involves performing functional, performance, security, and other types of tests to identify defects and issues in the software. Manual testing requires testers to have a high level of testing skills and experience, as well as a significant amount of time and resources.

### Pros and Cons of Manual Testing

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Flexibility: Manual testing can adjust the test plan and test cases according to the tester's experience and judgment. | Time and cost: Manual testing requires a lot of time and human resources, especially for large and complex software projects. |
| Applicability: Manual testing can be applied to various testing scenarios and types, including functional testing, performance testing, security testing, etc. | Repetitiveness: Manual testing is prone to human interference, and the repeatability and accuracy of test results are limited. |
| User-friendly: Manual testing can simulate the operation and behavior of real users, which is more in line with actual usage scenarios. | Coverage: The coverage of manual testing is limited by the tester's experience and skills, and some test cases and scenarios may be missed. |
| Low cost: Compared with automated testing, manual testing has a lower cost and does not require additional tools and equipment. | |
